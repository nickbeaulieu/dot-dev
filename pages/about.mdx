## Hey üëãüèª I'm Nick.

As a founding engineer at Stashpad, I've had the opportunity to build a variety of systems and APIs from scratch, and troubleshoot interesting bugs that emerged while scaling from hundreds to thousands of users. I've worked directly with our customers to understand their needs, and build new features from end-to-end in conjunction with them. I really enjoy finding and optimizing slow code paths, and have come to love the Chrome debugger.

In my spare time, I've started working on a compiler for a new programming language called [torch](https://github.com/nickbeaulieu/torch) which I'm implementing in Typescript, and compiling to C. The project is still very much a prototype, but torch is already turing-complete!
