## Intro

Hey Luke,

I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself. I noticed that you were hiring on LinkedIn, and it really caught my eye as I'm looking for a role as a Senior Software Engineer. I am currently on the founding team of [Stashpad](https://stashpad.com), which is unfortunately shutting down. I have gotten a ton of experience setting up new systems and APIs from scratch, and in my last job led the development of the texting platform at [Levitate](https://levitate.ai). My experience aligns closely with what you're searching for and I know I can help scale Textla up to the next level.

A little more about me...

I've been a full stack engineer for about 6 years now. In my current role as an engineer on the founding team at Stashpad, I've had the opportunity to work on docs and writing tools crafted specifically for developers and other technical folks. I thoroughly enjoyed building our Slack integration at Stashpad, and have worked on a few smaller integrations here as well. I have direct experience with most of the tech stack you guys use (Next.js, React, Tailwind, Typescript), and have set up an API from scratch using the Cloudflare equivalents (Workers, D1, R2, Queues, etc.) of the AWS tools you use. I regularly meet with customers, and work closely with our designer to tweak the interface, and decide which new features we build.

In my last role at Levitate, I led the development of the texting platform, which we integrated with Bandwidth for. I designed the database models (MongoDB), and wrote all of the background jobs & business logic (in C#) for conversations and messages. I also guided two front-end devs on building the interface our customers interacted with.

In my spare time, I've started working on a compiler for a new programming language called [torch](https://github.com/nickbeaulieu/torch) which I'm implementing in Typescript (and building with Bun!), and compiling to C. The project is still very much a prototype, but torch is already turing-complete!

On a more personal note, I'm getting married this fall, and am really excited to be starting a new phase of life with my fiance Rebecca. We both love to cook, and my favorite dish to make from scratch is a beef bolognese. We also just got back from a trip to Glacier and Yellowstone, where we did quite a bit of hiking.

I'd love to chat with you to learn more about Textla, and share more about my experience and what I'll bring to the table joining the team. I'd like to understand your plans for hiring & scaling up to the next level.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
